# GitHub Integration Sample

Showcase for Spring Feign client library usage.

With Feign we query GitHub API and expose it using interface - fetch list of repositories. 

Then we addSPQR GraphQL annotations and use this API in React client. 

Also, we use the interface in Jmix backend UI screen to show list of repositories on it.
